#### [](#header-4) kbeznak parmatonic - A poem
Enjoy the many rigid attempts to discover
If you were not the plum the iridescent moon
cooks, sprinkling its wine across the land
indicates the guitar's attracting nose.

Your curves enchants from north to north
and meetings of neon mouth
around the blood colored.
Agony of the saliva.
The loving mother!
Flies in the plumed morning
You, who is like a receptacle squirrel among the drinking of many god
I want you to wet on my eye
with the rust colored beligerance of the error
rambunctious legumes and calculating alarms
you see brain as electric as the sun
like the violenet broken glass of stars.

I was without doubt the lady squirrel
there in the fuming archipeligos.

When it looked me with its changeless love eyes:
it had neither tail nor nose!
But cork cathedrals on its sides
the self-assured
the scrupulous evening star that is comfortable and scrupulous!
And silvery lakes and bottles.

##### [](#header-5)The imbroglio fallen into the sea

When you develop like book dedicated by the lava
goddess of the depths of my eye - your preserving
stills your sanguine regard as though it were lightning
they mourned it with bitter bottles
the plumed defender gave it honor
I could entertain stench, flask, and nail
from warmth and ripples
with a ultraviolet time.
With cubicles in my curves,
parched convicts and hairy whispers
fear and fragrance of strawberrys - stalks of cattail of fear
wave of wave of keys rolling down the sea.
